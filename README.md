## Description

Carrefour Kenya are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax).
This project has been divided into four parts where I'll explore a recent marketing datasets by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later provide recommendations based on the insights that will help inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies.

## Approach

 
### Part 1:Dimensionality Reduction inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategie

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using PCA. I performed analysis and provided insights gained from your analysis.

### Part 3:Association Rules

In this section I created association rules that help to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. The dataset used comprises groups of items that are associated with others. Just like in the other sections, I provided insights for the analysis.

You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
